Web page solver for the NYT Spelling Bee daily puzzle

I've always found the NYT Spelling Bee puzzle format to be difficult, so I'm building a solution generator.
This web page will allow the user to input today's letters, and generate a list of valid answers to the puzzle.
The user will be able to check off words from the list that they have already used in the puzzle.

Have created initial HTML and CSS layout that works well enough to start working on the JavaScript. Webpage currently has no functionaly past the 'Clear' button.
